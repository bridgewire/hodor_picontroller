## Recommended Extra Materials for testing

1 - digital multimeter
1 - discrete LED
1 - breadboard
1 - resistor (recommend 220-1000 ohms)
1 - (optional) bench power supply capable of producing 5V and 12V

The breadboard, LED and resistor are recommended for testing units as they are
assembled.  The bench power supply is recommended since the Meanwell RD-35A
does not implement short-circuit protection, which can cause problems if power
lines accidentally contact during assembly and test.
